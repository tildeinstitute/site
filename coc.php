            <h1>tilde.institute code of conduct</h1>
            <p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: Be kind to each other. Think carefully about the words you
                use. Think carefully about what content you post and promote.</p>
            <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
            <p>A primary goal of tilde.institute is to be inclusive to the largest number of
                community members, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds
                possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and
                welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
                ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack
                thereof).</p>
            <p>This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who
                participate in our community, as well as the consequences for
                unacceptable behavior.</p>
            <p>We invite all those who participate in tilde.institute to help create safe
                and positive experiences for everyone.</p>
            <h2>2. Vision of tilde.institute</h2>
            <p><strong>tilde.institute exists to provide a safe, non-judgemental, and fun place to
                    explore creative projects and to seek intentional digital community.</strong></p>
            <p>In a post-facebook age, it is up to small communities to gather and work
                together to provide a space outside of the advertising-laden, corporate
                mediated world of social media.</p>
            <p>To that end, tilde.institute strives to be a radically inclusive community
                where people of all backgrounds and all technological experience levels
                can come together for peer education, to delight in one another's
                creations and to make good conversation.</p>
            <h2>3. Expected Behavior</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you
                    contribute to the health and longevity of tilde.institute.</li>
                <li>Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.</li>
                <li>Attempt collaboration before conflict.</li>
                <li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and
                    speech.</li>
                <li>If anyone asks you to stop a particular kind of behavior, always err
                    on the side of respecting their wishes. If you believe their request
                    is unreasonable or unfair, ask an admin, but don't respond with
                    hostility.</li>
                <li>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.
                    Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone
                    in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, even if they
                    seem inconsequential.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>4. Unacceptable Behavior</h2>
            <p>Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive,
                discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any
                tilde.institute user online, at any related events, or in one-on-one
                communication carried out in the conduct of tilde.institute related projects.
                Community event venues--physical or digital--may be shared with members
                of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.</p>
            <p>Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments
                related to gender, age, sexual orientation, race, religious choices,
                disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public
                spaces (like your \~ html pages); deliberate intimidation, stalking, or
                following; harassing recording; sustained disruption of the work of
                others; and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
            <h2>5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h2>
            <p>Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including those with
                decision making authority or <code>sudo</code>, will not be tolerated.</p>
            <p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.
                If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the tilde.institute admins
                may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban
                or permanent expulsion from tilde.institute (meaning your user account would be
                revoked) without warning.</p>
            <h2>6. If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior</h2>
            <p>If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any
                other concerns, please see the Contact Information section below.</p>
            <p>Additionally, help engaging with law enforcement is always available.</p>
