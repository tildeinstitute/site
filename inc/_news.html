<p>Upgraded to OpenBSD 6.8!</p>

<em>2020 July 04</em>
<p>Mail has been switched from the <code>mbox</code> format to <code>maildir</code>. Mail will now be delivered straight to your home directory, into <code>~/Maildir</code>. You'll need to update your mutt configs:<br />
<code>set mbox_type=Maildir<br />
set folder="~/Maildir"<br />
set mbox="~/Maildir"<br />
set spoolfile="~/Maildir"</code></p>
<p>I've installed a script to convert your mbox file to maildir. Just run this:</p>
<p><code>mb2md -s /var/mail/$USER -d ~/Maildir</code></p>
<p><code>alpine</code> has been rebuilt with the maildir patch.</p>

<p>Some ssh host heys were regenerated and I also deployed SSHFP records. If you receive an error
    related to this when connecting,
    remove the old host key fingerprint:</p>
<p><code>ssh-keygen -R tilde.institute</code></p>
<p>Then connect and tell ssh to check the sshfp records:</p>
<p><code>ssh -o "VerifyHostKeyDNS ask" &lt;user&gt;@tilde.institute</code></p>
<br />
