<p>Some ssh host heys were regenerated and I also deployed SSHFP records. If you receive an error
    related to this when connecting,
    remove the old host key fingerprint:</p>
<p><code>ssh-keygen -R tilde.institute</code></p>
<p>Then connect and tell ssh to check the sshfp records:</p>
<p><code>ssh -o "VerifyHostKeyDNS ask" &lt;user&gt;@tilde.institute</code></p>
